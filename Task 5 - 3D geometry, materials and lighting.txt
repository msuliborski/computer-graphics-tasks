Exercise 5 - 3D geometry, materials and lighting
Modify your program from the previous exercise in order to create animated 3D planetary system containing: 
• one star,
• at least 4 planets,
• at least 7 moons orbiting around at least 3 of the planets.
Each of the celestial bodies should be a sphere, a box or a custom geometry loaded from the obj file format (each of the three possibilities should occur) and should have a different color (including specular) or be textured (both versions should appear). The orbit, the angle of the rotation axis and the speed should be diversified.
Three types of light in the scene should be created:
• point light from a star (with the emissive material)
• directional light,
• spotlight from one of the planets, shining vertically from the surface.
